Blog Project - Decola Tech 2025

This project is a simple blog developed using Angular as part of the Decola Tech 2025 bootcamp. Through this project, I practiced and reinforced key web development skills, including:

    HTML and CSS for structuring and styling web pages
    TypeScript for building dynamic and scalable applications
    Angular fundamentals, such as components, modules, and services
    Routing and navigation in Angular applications
    Data binding and event handling

This project served as a hands-on learning experience to deepen my understanding of front-end development with Angular. ðŸš€
